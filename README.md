# School-championship
Something like the annual sports function of an institution(except only two people can compete against each other in a game). 6 different events and max no. of participants in a single event is 100. This program will finally output who is the most athletic according to wins in all the events. I've used Elo's rating algorithm to relatively assign scores after each game.
